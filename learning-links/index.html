James Arthur
I don't want to play this game no more
I don't wanna play it
I don't want to stay 'round here no more
I don't wanna stay here
Like rain on a monday morning
Like pain that just keeps on going on
Look at all the hate they keep on showing
I don't want to see that
Look at all the stones they keep on throwing
I don't want to feel that
Like sun that will keep on burning
I used to be so discerning, oh
In my recovery
I'm a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined, I designed
My recovery
In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined, I designed
My recovery
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery
And I can hear the choirs keep on singing
Tell me what they're saying
And I can hear the phone, it keeps on ringing
I don't want to…
In my recovery
I'm a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined, I designed
My recovery
In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined, I designed
My recovery
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery
In my recovery
I'm a soldier at war
I have broken down walls
I defined, I designed
My recovery
In the sound of the sea
In the oceans of me
I defined, I designed
My recovery
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing
My recovery
Keep soaring
Keep song-writing

Our glasses high
Women, late nights, alcohol and twists
Delights were doing me the worst damage ...
Ah, my passions, my mistakes,
I sing to you, my love
That now I am on my number one ...
             
To my health I drink and get drunk
And I count my mistakes
And all night I sing ..
Let the good go old
I say goodbye and bye-bye
To what blackens my heart.
Our glasses high
And everyone on the tables
Then we dance...
We live only once
But if you do it right
It's enough to have a good time
             
In my joys and celebrations
All friends and acquaintances
But during the difficult, during the longing
Not even half of them stayed ...
I paid for my mistakes,
The change I gave away
And I have now changed people...
             
To my health I drink and get drunk
And I count my mistakes
And all night I sing ..
Let the good go old
I say goodbye and bye-bye
To what blackens my heart.
Our glasses high
And everyone on the tables
Then we dance...
We live only once
But if you do it right
It's enough to have a good time
             
Our glasses high (x2)
And everyone on the tables
Then we dance...
             
To my health I drink and get drunk
And I count my mistakes
And all night I sing ..
Let the good go old
I say goodbye and bye-bye
To what blackens my heart.
Our glasses high
And everyone on the tables
Then we dance...
We live only once
But if you do it right

<p id=Hallelujah>
    <pre>
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you dont really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor falls, the major lifts
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Well, maybe there's a God above
As for me all I've ever learned from love
Is how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
But it's not a crime that you're hear tonight
It's not some pilgrim who claims to have…
